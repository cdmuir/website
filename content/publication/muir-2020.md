abstract = "Stomatal pores control both leaf gas exchange and are an entry for many plant pathogens, setting up the potential for tradeoffs between photosynthesis and defense. To prevent colonization and limit infection, plants close their stomata after recognizing pathogens. In addition to closing stomata, anatmoical shifts to lower stomatal density and/or size may also limit pathogen colonization, but such developmental changes would permanently reduce the gas exchange capacity for the life of the leaf. I developed and analyzed a spatially explicit model of pathogen colonization on the leaf as a function of stomatal size and density, anatomical traits which determine maximum rates of gas exchange. The model predicts greater stomatal size or density increases colonization, but the effect is most pronounced when stomatal cover is low. I also derived scaling relationships between stomatal size and density that preserves a given probability of colonization. These scaling relationships set up a potential conflict between maximizing defense and minimizing stomatal cover. To my knowledge, this is the first mathematical model connecting gas exchange and pathogen defense via stomatal anatomy. It makes predictions that can be tested with experiments and may explain variation in stomatal anatomy among plants. The model is generalizable to many types of pathogens, but lacks significant biological realism that may be needed for accurate predictions."
