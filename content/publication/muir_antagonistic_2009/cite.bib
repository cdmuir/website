  abstract = {Epistasis, the nonadditive interaction between loci, is thought to play a role in many fundamental evolutionary processes, including adaptive differentiation and speciation. Focusing on species differences in ecophysiological traits, we examined the strength and direction of pairwise epistatic interactions between target chromosomal regions from one species, when co-introgressed into the genetic background of a foreign species.},
