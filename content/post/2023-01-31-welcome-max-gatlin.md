I want to welcome a new technician [Max Gatlin]({{< ref "/authors/gatlin" >}}) to the lab! Max is originally from Gresham, Oregon and graduated from UH in Fall 2022 with a BS in Biology. I also had him in my BIOL 220 and 470 classes a couple years ago. Max has done research in labs studying marine fungi and their potential as anti-cancer drugs, the micro ecosystems of bromeliads, declining populations of yellow-faced bees, a bee native only to Hawaii, and synthesis of chemicals using bacteria. Max likes to surf, swim in the ocean, play guitar, and read. His scientific interests include plants, microorganisms, insects, and human, one of which he hopes to study in graduate school. One dream of his is explore new areas of natural and discover new species. His project is a little less ambitious though. He is working on an NIH pilot project to find out more about how leaf pathogens get from the atmosphere into the mesophyll.
