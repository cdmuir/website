## Announcements

* Last week of class! Woohoo!

* I will give you feedback on data analysis plan this week.

* I will be sending out details on the Final Project written/oral presentations

* Final Project presentations are scheduled for **Thursday, May 14 @ 12 PM HST**. You can join the Google Meeting using this link: [meet.google.com/xxj-wayo-kxf](https://meet.google.com/xxj-wayo-kxf)

## Assignments:

* There will be a regular lab assignment on correlation in *R* 

* Complete all labs by **Tuesday, May 12 @ 11:59 PM HST**

* Work on your Final Project!

## Readings:

* Whitlock & Schluter, Chapter 15: Comparing means of more than two groups

* Whitlock & Schluter, Chapter 16: Correlation between numerial variables

Note: I recommend reading by Chapter 15 and 16 by the end of the semester. For this week, focus on whichever will be more useful for your final project.

## Schedule

Note that on Tuesday, class will meet synchronously on Google Meet [meet.google.com/foi-xwhi-ape](https://meet.google.com/vhq-qczv-dew). Class will be recorded and posted online if you are unable to attend. 

### Tuesday, May 5 - synchronous

* *Read* Chapters 15 and/or 16 textbook

* *Watch* pre-recorded lecture by Dr. Yaniv Brandvain on ANOVA:

{{< youtube fuef3mb6ibk >}}

  - Note that this lecture is a bit longer (43 minutes) than previous ones
  - PDF of slides are posted on Laulima

* We'll go over background and code demo of ANOVA.

### Thursday, May 7 - lab

* Lab on Correlation in *R* (I will post by Wednesday night)

* Join Google Meeting at 12: [meet.google.com/vhq-qczv-dew](https://meet.google.com/vhq-qczv-dew)

### Code demo (ANOVA)
