## Purpose

This is for students currently enrolled in BIOL 470: Evolutionary Biology at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. As you know, the remainder of our course will be delievered online. The purpose of this post is to give students resources for getting started with this transition. This is a living document and will be revised and updated as necessary. Other instructors are welcome to reuse any of the resources found here and elsewhere on my website.

## Communication

**Check your email reguarly**

### Instructor-to-student

I will continue posting all important messages on the class Laulima site and notifying you of these announcements via your UH email address.

### Student-to-instructor

**Urgent matters** that require immediate response: [Email me](mailto:cdmuir@hawaii.edu) using the subject "BIOL470 EMERGENCY"

**Non-urgent matters**: You should continue to use the [online issue tracker](https://forms.gle/23rgjmTi53zvcPVe6) to submit nonurgent questions and concerns about the course. I will reply within two business days.

**Virtual office hours**: You can schedule a meeting with me using the STAR BALANCE system or by using the online issue tracker. My *preferred* meeting times are:

* Mondays: 1:30-3:30
* Wednesdays: 1-3
* Thursdays: 1:30-3:30

All times are HST. I will try to accomodate if you want to meet outside these times.

### Student-to-student:

Some assignments will require working with your peers. To avoid unnecessary social contact, these meetings should be done online or over the phone. As of now, I am not requiring you use a specific platform, but that might change if I get more information. I recommend using email or setting up meetings on [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/).

## Course structure

Class materials will be delivered using a mix of *synchronous* (~1/3) and *asynchronous* (~2/3) instruction. At the beginning of each week I will post a schedule of materials and notify you when it's posted.

For *synchronous* instruction, students are expected to join class online via a Google Meeting unless their situation (e.g. time zone, poor Internet connection, etc.) precludes it. Information on using Google Meetings is below. **All synchronous meetings will be recorded** so they can be put online for students unable to attend.

*Asynchronous* instruction can be done on your own schedule. However, it is important to keep up and not to cram at the end. This will involve a mix of watching recorded material, reading materials besides your text book, and completing activities. The exact mode of instruction will evolve as we transition online.

## Google Meetings

I will schedule synchronous class meetings and invite you via Google Meetings. **You will need to check your email for details on joining class online**.

Because we have 110 students, once you join, it's critical that you **disable your audio and video**. Otherwise, we will all be able to see and hear you! To do this, make the sure microphone and camera buttons are red when you join the meeting, like this:

<img alt = 'google-meetings-1' width='600' src='/img/google-meetings-1.png' ALIGN = 'center'/>

Use the Chat function (on the right side) to ask questions during class unless otherwise instructed.

<img alt = 'google-meetings-2' width='300' src='/img/google-meetings-2.png' ALIGN = 'center'/>

Hopefully, you will simply be able to join the class and not have a need for more advanced features. But if you are looking for help on Google Meetings, see these resources:
