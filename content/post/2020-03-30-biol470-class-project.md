## Description

In this class, we've examined the research of many evolutionary biologists and met some of them virtually as guest lecturers. This project will give you the opportunity to be part of original evolutionary research by taking part in a distributed phylogenetic comparative analysis over the next 2+ weeks. In addition to weekly participation points, completing your portion of the project will be part of your Midterm Exam 3 grade. We will synthesize everyone's results in class to test competing hypotheses.

## Learning objectives

* synthesize data from the primary literature
* combine individual datasets into a comparative dataset
* construct phylogenies
* apply phylogenetic comparative methods to test hypotheses
