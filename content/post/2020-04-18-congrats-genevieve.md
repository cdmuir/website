Congrats [Genevieve]({{< ref "/post/2020-01-31-welcome-genevieve" >}}) on being awarded [UROP](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/undergrad/urop/) funding to study "Protection or production? Using QTL mapping to isolate how stomatal ratio affects photosynthesis and pathogen defense"! In Fall 2020, she'll be fine-mapping stomatal QTL in wild tomatoes.
