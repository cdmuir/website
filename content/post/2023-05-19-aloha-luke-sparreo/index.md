summary: "Luke Sparreo heads back to Connecticut after a semester in Hawai ªi"
---

I want to say aloha to [Luke Sparreo]({{< ref "/authors/lsparreo" >}}) who worked in the lab took my evolutionary biology class this past semester. Luke is originally from the Chicago area and visiting UH for a semester. He normally attends [Connecticut College](https://www.conncoll.edu/), where he majors in botany and environmental studies and will graduate in 2024. His past research focused on human influences on the domestication and evolution of maize. He enjoys hiking and gardening in his free time. Luke hopes to attend graduate school and is interested in plant systematics and conservation. Thank you Luke for your hard work this semester!
