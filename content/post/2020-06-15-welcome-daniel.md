Iâ€™m pleased to welcome Daniel Trupp to the lab. Daniel is a Botany and Computer Science double major from San Diego, California. He is a senior with a passion for plants and a drive for data science. Going forward, he hopes to create tools to make research easier and develop new ways to produce bioluminescent plants. I'm excited to welcome him to the lab!
