I would like to welcome a new undergraduate assistant Paul Yamane, a freshman studying biology at UH MƒÅnoa. Paul is studying to be a dentist after he graduates. He has already received funding from a [Entering Research and Creative Work](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/undergrad/urop/student-funding/erc/about/) from the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). With UROP funds, Paul will study variation in leaf venation among wild tomatoes. I am really excited to see what he finds.
