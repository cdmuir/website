I would like to welcome a new undergraduate assistant Paul Yamane, a freshman studying biology at UH Mānoa. Paul is a freshman at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa originally from Maui. Paul is studying to be an orthodontist after he graduates because he says "first impressions are everything when meeting new people or even a job interview, and a perfect smile is a great way to achieve a good first impression." Outside of school, Paul enjoys reading and going to the gym. Paul has already received funding from a [Entering Research and Creative Work](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/undergrad/urop/student-funding/erc/about/) from the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). With UROP funds, Paul will study variation in leaf venation among wild tomatoes. I am really excited to see what he finds.
