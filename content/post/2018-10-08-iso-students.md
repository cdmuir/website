I am recruiting MS and PhD students in my lab to start Fall 2020. I am broadly interested in solving basic problems in evolutionary physiology using plant systems and quantitative approaches. Check out my [projects]( {{< ref "project" >}}) page for more information on current work. I am enthusiastic to supervise students who want to work on an existing system in the lab, but I also welcome opportunities to supervise students who want to study Hawaiian plants. 

## How to apply

1. [Email me](mailto:cdmuir@hawaii.edu) with a short expression of interest.
2. Check out [application instructions](http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/graduate-program/) on the UH Botany webpage.

## Resources

I strongly encourage students to apply for fellowships. I would love to discuss potential projects for a proposal that could be done in my lab.
