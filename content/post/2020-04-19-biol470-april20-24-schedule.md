## Schedule

Note that on Wednesday, class will meet synchronously on Google Meet [meet.google.com/qip-dcci-fjy](https://meet.google.com/qip-dcci-fjy). Class will be recorded and posted online if you are unable to attend. Remaining instruction will be asynchronous, meaning you can work at your own pace and desired time.

### Monday, April 20 - asynchronous

* I will post a recorded lecture on Macroevolution. Note also that I posted lectures on Speciation on Friday and Sunday, so watch those by Wednesday if you haven't already. I'm trying to keep the burden low until exams are done.

### Wednesday, April 15 - synchronous, join Google Meeting

* We will finish our section on Speciation with a guest lecture from [Dr. Robin Hopkinds](http://hopkins-lab.org/) talking about her lab's research on reinforcement.

### Friday, April 17 - asynchronous

* TBA, but I am planning post results from our class comparative analysis and finish Macroevolution
