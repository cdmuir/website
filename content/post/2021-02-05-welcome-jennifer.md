I am pleased to welcome Jennifer Guo to the lab. Jennifer is a junior at the University of Hawaiʻi, Mānoa and majors in computer engineering. She has a passion for machine learning and data analysis. She wants to use machines learning algorithms to research and hopefully improve the efficiency of microCT image analysis on plant organs. I am excited to welcome her to the lab!
