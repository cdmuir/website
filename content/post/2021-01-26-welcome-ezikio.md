I’m pleased to welcome Ezikio Quintana to the lab. They'll be working in the field, greenhouse, and lab this semester. Ezikio Quintana is majoring in Natural Resources and Environmental Management, with a focus on Community Resource Management. They are from Kaua'i, Hawai'i. They care deeply for lā'au Hawai'i and indigenous agricultural systems, and about helping proliferate the knowledge and practice of both in their community.
