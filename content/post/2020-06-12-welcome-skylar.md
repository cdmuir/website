I'm pleased to welcome Skylar Hara to the lab! She took my Biostats class this spring - You can read about her final project [here]({{< ref "post/2020-05-20-biol297-skylar-covid19.md" >}}).

Skylar is currently a BS student in the Tropical Agriculture and the Environment program at the University of Hawai’i Mānoa. She has a growing love for anything related to plants. In the future, she hopes to go to graduate school to conduct research for conservation efforts, focusing on native plants in Hawai’i.
