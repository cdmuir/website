I am happy to welcome recent Colgate graduate Jacob Watts to the lab for the summer of 2021. He will be working on optimal stomatal arrangement in amphistomatous leaves across different light environments. Additionally, he will travel with me to UC Davis to model and measure gas exchange properties of leaves with varying internal anatomies, including wild tomatoes (*Solanum*) and *Arctostaphylos*. At Colgate, Jacob majored in Biology with a minor in Geography. He is passionate about evolutionary biogeography and takes particular joy in studying ferns. This fall, he plans to attend Cambridge University to pursue an MPhil in Plant Sciences. Welcome to the lab, Jacob!
