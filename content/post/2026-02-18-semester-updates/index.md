This semester has been very eventful in the Muir lab, with two new graduate students ([Ariella](/author/ariella-thompson/) and [Freyja](/author/freyja-moser/)) being admitted and [Frank](/author/dachuan-wang/) obtaining dissertator status and a MS in Botany!

Everyone has been working hard, submitting applications for funding and making great strides in their research projects. [Eddie](/author/eduardo-barragan/) and [Ariella](/author/ariella-thompson/) have applied to the [Lewis and Clark Fund for Exploration and Research](https://www.amphilsoc.org/grants/lewis-and-clark-fund-exploration-and-field-research) to possibly secure funding for field collection projects in summer 2026. [Eddie](/author/eduardo-barragan/) aims to collect measurements and samples in Hawaiʻi to study the adaptive radiation of Hawaiian *Bidens*, while [Ariella's](/author/ariella-thompson/) goal is to collect *Mimulus tilingii* seeds and leaves across the mountain ranges of the Western United States to measure trichome trait variation. Additionally, [Freyja](/author/freyja-moser/) and [Ariella](/author/ariella-thompson/) worked extensively to submit applications to both the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the [Simons Graduate Fellowship in Ecology and Evolution](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/grant/simons-graduate-fellowships-in-ecology-and-evolution/) this semester. Outside of applying for funding, everyone has been forging ahead, learning new lab skills, collecting data, planting seeds, and planning the next steps in their projects. All of this could not be done without the amazing undergraduates in the lab. [Lily](/author/lily-danz/) started taking new microscopy images for [Frank](/author/dachuan-wang/) this semester, and [Aren](/author/aren-gonzales/), a former field technician, is beginning to apply to postgrad opportunities with a Public Health lab as she gears up for the next step in her career.
