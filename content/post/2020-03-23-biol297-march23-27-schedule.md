## Summary

This will be our first week of class completely online. Please be patient and flexible; I will do likewise. Please let me know if you are having issues learning remotely so we can address problems right away. This schedule is tentative and subject to change.

## Assignments:

* Complete any remaining labs 1--6 by Tuesday if you still want credit

* There will be a mini-lab assignment on analyzing proportions in *R* due by next Tuesday.

## Readings:

* Whitlock & Schluter, Chapter 7: Analyzing proportions

## Schedule

Note that on Tuesday, class will meet synchronously on Google Meet [meet.google.com/foi-xwhi-ape](https://meet.google.com/foi-xwhi-ape). Class will be recorded and posted online if you are unable to attend. Remaining instruction will be asynchronous, meaning you can work at your own pace and desired time.

In general, I strongly recommend attending synchronous meetings if you can. I also recommend establishing routine times that you work on asynchronous assignments. A routine will help you develop good work habits, keep you engaged in the class, and prevent you from having to cram later.

### Tuesday, March 24

* Go over Midterm Exam 2

* We will introduce Analysis of Proportions

* Address questions and concerns about online instruction

* *Read* chapter 7 from textbook

* *Watch* (additional prerecorded instruction, link TBA)

### Thursday, March 26

Kuhio day - no class

### On your own

Since there is no official lab this week because of Kuhio day, we will have a mini-Lab 7 on Proportions in *R*! I will notify when I post this. The lab structure will be similar to previous labs, but it will be more of an assignment to give you practice analyzing proportions.
