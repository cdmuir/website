## Announcements

I found a student worker to scan your graded Midterm Exam 2. I will deliver those to you securely as soon as they are done, but it might take a few days.

## Assignments:

* Participate in Laulima discussion on COVID-19 evolution videos and reading by  **Tuesday, March 31** @ 11:59 PM HST.

  - Go to Laulima, click "Discussion and Private Messages", then "Class Discussions". Post under "	Phylogenetics and COVID-19 readings"

## Readings:

* Zimmer & Emlen, Chapter XXX

## Schedule

Note that on Wednesday, class will meet synchronously on Google Meet [meet.google.com/qip-dcci-fjy](https://meet.google.com/qip-dcci-fjy). Class will be recorded and posted online if you are unable to attend. Remaining instruction will be asynchronous, meaning you can work at your own pace and desired time.

In general, I strongly recommend attending synchronous meetings if you can. I also recommend establishing routine times that you work on asynchronous assignments. A routine will help you develop good work habits, keep you engaged in the class, and prevent you from having to cram later.

### Monday, March 30 - asynchronous

**Participate in Laulima discussion!!**

* *Read*

* *Study*

### Wednesday, April 1 - synchronous, join Google Meeting

* We will finish phylogenetics with a guest lecture from [Dr. Matt Hahn](https://sandykawano.weebly.com/) talking about his reseach on using the multispecies coalescent to infer phylogenies.

* We will introduce the next topic...

### Friday, March April 3

* Finish reading Chapter XXX and additional readings



## OLD

* *Study* online module on the gene trees and coalescent simulations:

  - [Part 1](https://cdmuir.netlify.com/post/2020-03-25-biol470-gene-trees1)
  
  - [Part 2]((https://cdmuir.netlify.com/post/2020-03-25-biol470-gene-trees2))

* *Watch* videos

  - Video 1 (15 minutes): [Using phylogenies to track COVID-19 (aka SarsCov2)](https://vimeo.com/395051566)

{{< vimeo 395051566 >}}

  - Video 2 (12 minutes): [Where did COVID19 come from? Where's it going?](https://youtu.be/MHRGPzoFyEM)

{{< youtube MHRGPzoFyEM >}}


* *Read* chapter 8 from textbook, plus a paper and blog post on using phylogenies to understand the origins of COVID-19. See links in the "Readings" section.

Note that these readings are highly technical and I don't expect you to understand much of the detail. Focus on the questions that motivated the study, the evolutionary approaches the authors used, the main conclusions, and remaining uncertainty. 

* *Discuss* video and readings for 1 participation point. Go to Laulima, click "Discussion and Private Messages", then "Class Discussions". Post under "Phylogenetics and COVID-19 readings"

### Friday, March 27

* Finish reading Chapter 8 and additional readings

* *Study* online module on the multispecies coalescent (link TBA, might be weekend or next week)

* Continue *discussion* on video and readings from Wednesday

* *Activity*: simulate multispecies coalescent using genomic data and compile results with class (will be up later today, so work on over the weekend or early next week)
