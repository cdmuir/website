---

I want to welcome a new summer research assistant [Brandon Najarian]({{< ref "/authors/najarian" >}}) to the lab! Brandon recently graduate from UH Mānoa is Spring 2023 with a BA in Botany. For his undergraduate research, he updated the vegetation survey of [Mānana Islet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81nana) and found 46 species (the highest species count of the 21 surveys conducted since 1927) with ten new records (of the 10, 1 native: *Sesbania tomentosa*). His work informs [DLNR](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/) restoration plans for the seabird sanctuary. In Fall 2023, he will begin graduate school at UH Mānoa studying the ecology of coastal strand plant communities on main Hawaiian islands and islets. Brandonʻs ultimate goal is to provide information to assist with the conservation of coastlines around the state. In his free time, Brandon enjoys hiking, botanizing, iNaturalist, reading, seed collecting. Welcome Brandon!
