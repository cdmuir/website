## Description

In response to moving the course online, I have decided to combine the final project and exam into a larger project that will be 35% of your final grade. As decided in class, everyone will analyze by, themselves or with a partner, a dataset to test a hypothesis that could explain why COVID-19 has spread more rapidly in some US states than others. This page is a placeholder for further information on this project. I will notify you via email when I make important updates.

## Learning objectives

* translate questions and scientific hypotheses into testable statistical hypotheses
* synthesize data from online sources
* analyze data using a null hypothesis testing framework
* draw appropriate conclusions
* communicate quantitative information effectively through written and visual media

## Timeline:

* **Friday, April 10**: One paragraph proposal of scientific question and hypothesis

* **Friday, April 24**: Get all data you will need to complete project

* **Friday, May 1**: 1-2 paragraph data analysis plan

* **Thursday, May 14**

  - Code and blog-style report for lay readers due
  - Online symposium of results with 5-10 minute presentations
