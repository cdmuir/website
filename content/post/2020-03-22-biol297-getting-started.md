## Purpose

This is for students currently enrolled in BIOL/BOT 297: Biostatistics at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. As you know, the remainder of our course will be delievered online. The purpose of this post is to give students resources for getting started with this transition. This is a living document and will be revised and updated as necessary. Other instructors are welcome to reuse any of the resources found here and elsewhere on my website.

## Communication

**Check your email reguarly**

I will continue posting all important messages on the class Laulima site and notifying you of these announcements via your UH email address.

[Email](mailto:cdmuir@hawaii.edu) is the best way to reach me if you have questions or concerns.

**Virtual office hours**: You can schedule a meeting with me using the STAR BALANCE system or by using the online issue tracker. My *preferred* meeting times are:

* Mondays: 1:30-3:30
* Wednesdays: 1-3
* Thursdays: 1:30-3:30

All times are HST. I will try to accomodate if you want to meet outside these times.

Some assignments will require working with your peers. To avoid unnecessary social contact, these meetings should be done online or over the phone. I recommend using email or setting up meetings on [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/).

## Course structure

Class materials will be delivered using a mix of *synchronous* and *asynchronous* instruction. At the beginning of each week I will post a schedule of materials and notify you when it's posted.

For Tuesday lectures, we may sometimes have synchronous instruction, meaning students are expected to join class online via a Google Meeting unless their situation (e.g. time zone, poor Internet connection, etc.) precludes it. Information on using Google Meetings is below. **All synchronous meetings will be recorded** so they can be put online for students unable to attend.

For Thursday labs, I will set up a Google Meeting during regularly scheduled class time so you can ask me questions as you work on your lab. It's OK if you choose to work on your lab at a different time, but I may not be available to answer questions immediately.

Other *asynchronous* instruction can be done on your own schedule. However, it is important to keep up and not to cram at the end. This will involve a mix of watching recorded material, reading materials besides your text book, and completing activities. The exact mode of instruction will evolve as we transition online.

## Google Meetings

I will schedule synchronous class meetings and invite you via Google Meetings. **You will need to check your email for details on joining class online**.

Hopefully, you will simply be able to join the class and not have a need for more advanced features. But if you are looking for help on Google Meetings, see these resources:
