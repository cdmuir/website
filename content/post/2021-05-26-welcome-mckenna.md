I am excited to welcome McKenna Bonn-Savage to the lab! She will be working on a UROP-funded project mentored by Kasey Barton and mysellf. McKenna is a Botany major with a Music and Spanish minor. She is an undergraduate junior with interests in plant ecology, physiology, and agricultural applications of botany. For her project, she will be working on measuring stomatal density and size, and digitizing slides from silver birch trees over their developmental lifetime. She hopes to use this research to publish a paper and go to graduate school for Botany
