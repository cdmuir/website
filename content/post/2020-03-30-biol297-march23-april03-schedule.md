## Assignments:

* There will be a regular lab assignment on analyzing frequency data in *R* due by next Tuesday.

## Readings:

* Whitlock & Schluter, Chapter 8: Fitting Probability Models to Frequency Data

## Schedule

Note that on Tuesday, class will meet synchronously on Google Meet [meet.google.com/foi-xwhi-ape](https://meet.google.com/foi-xwhi-ape). Class will be recorded and posted online if you are unable to attend. Remaining instruction will be asynchronous, meaning you can work at your own pace and desired time.

In general, I strongly recommend attending synchronous meetings if you can. I also recommend establishing routine times that you work on asynchronous assignments. A routine will help you develop good work habits, keep you engaged in the class, and prevent you from having to cram later.

### Tuesday, March 31

* Join Google Meeting at 12 [meet.google.com/vhq-qczv-dew](https://meet.google.com/vhq-qczv-dew)

* Address questions about last week's mini-lab

* We will introduce *Fitting Probability Models to Frequency Data* using $\chi^2$-tests

* Go over class project

* *Read* chapter 8 from textbook

* *Watch* pre-recorded lecture by a friend of mine, Dr. Yaniv Brandvain:

{{< youtube 2d4rleMG9Uk >}}

This lecture covers tests of frequency data. You only need to watch through 24:00. The material after that is more advanced, so you are welcome to continue watching, but it's not material we'll cover in this class.

### Thursday, April 3

* Lab on Frequency data in *R* (I will post by Wednesday)

* Join Google Meeting at 12 [meet.google.com/vhq-qczv-dew](https://meet.google.com/vhq-qczv-dew)
