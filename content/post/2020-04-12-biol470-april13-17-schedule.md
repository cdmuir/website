## Announcements

* Midterm Exam 3 will be handed out the morning of Monday, April 13. I will post an announcement on Laulima when it is available and email you. All exam materials will be delivered to you and returned to me through your individual Google Drive folder for thic class. Please let me know ASAP if you are having problems accessing this folder.

* The due date for the exam has been extended to **Tuesday, April 21 @ 11:59PM HST**

* There will be a live "review session" on Google Meet either Wednesday or Thursday. I will notify as soon as I know what time. You will be able to submit questions ahead of time and I will record it if you can't attend synchronously.

* I will post participation grades for class project data entry later this week

## Assignments:

* No discussion or guest speaker this week so that you have time to work on your exam

## Readings:

* Emlen & Zimmer, Chapter 13 *On the Origin of Species*

* Reading on Phylogenetic Comparative Methods (in your Laulima/Resource/primary-literature folder)

  - This reading is optional, but I suggest reading pages 90-92 for help on interpretating phylogenetic comparative methods on your exam.
  - Pennel MW and LJ Harmon. 2013. An integrative view of phylogenetic comparative methods: connections to population genetics, community ecology, and paleobiology. *Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences*. 1289: 90â€“105.
  
## Schedule

Note that on Wednesday, class will meet synchronously on Google Meet [meet.google.com/qip-dcci-fjy](https://meet.google.com/qip-dcci-fjy). Class will be recorded and posted online if you are unable to attend. Remaining instruction will be asynchronous, meaning you can work at your own pace and desired time.

In general, I strongly recommend attending synchronous meetings if you can. I also recommend establishing routine times that you work on asynchronous assignments. A routine will help you develop good work habits, keep you engaged in the class, and prevent you from having to cram later.

### Monday, April 5 - asynchronous

* Midterm Exam 3 handed out. I strongly advise reading over the exam soon and making a plan to complete. You will have trouble finishing if you wait until the last minute.

* *Watch* pre-recorded lecture on speciation

  - I will post video on Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning

### Wednesday, April 8 - synchronous, join Google Meeting

* More on Speciation (more detail TBA)

### Friday, April 10 - asynchronous

* Speciation/macroevolution (more detail TBA)
