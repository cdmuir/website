I am recruiting PhD students to join beginning Fall 2024. Please get in touch to find out more!

Potential projects should address the adaptive significance of various traits using plants as model systems. Approaches include, but are not limited to:

* Developing adaptive hypotheses using optimality modeling
* Testing the generality of adaptation using phylogenetic comparative methods
* Test adaptive hypotheses using lab and/or field experiments
