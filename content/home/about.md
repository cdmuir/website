# About the Quantitative Evolutionary Physiology Lab

My lab is located in the [Department of Botany](http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/) at the University of Hawai'i in beautiful M&amacr;noa. We study how plants work and why they evolved to work that way using a combination of experimental, comparative, and quantitative approaches. Please check out the [Projects]({{< ref "#projects">}}) page for more information on current research. If these types of questions interest you, please [contact me](mailto:cdmuir@hawaii.edu) about working together!
