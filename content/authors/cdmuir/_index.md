My lab is located in the [Department of Botany](https://botany.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. We study how plants work and why they evolved to work that way using a combination of experimental, comparative, and quantitative approaches. Please check out the [Research]({{< ref "research">}}) page for more information on current research. If these types of questions interest you, please [contact me](mailto:cdmuir@wisc.edu) about working together!
