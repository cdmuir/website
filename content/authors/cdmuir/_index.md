#     summary: |
#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

My lab is located in the [Department of Botany](https://botany.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. We study how plants work and why they evolved to work that way using a combination of experimental, comparative, and quantitative approaches. Please check out the [Research]({{< ref "research">}}) page for more information on current research. If these types of questions interest you, please [contact me](mailto:cdmuir@wisc.edu) about working together!
